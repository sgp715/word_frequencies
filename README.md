# Word Frequencies

For this homework you will design and implement a word frequency counting program, freq, in Rust. The objective of this homework is to get you writing Rust code, and to help you gain familiarity with Rustâ€™s iterators, traits, and data structures.

## The deliverable

Your freq program consumes text from standard input. It prints a list of word-frequency counts, in descending order of frequency, to the standard output.
